Funny dash script for downloading ISOs of distros I like to keep on my ventoy USB
#

This script expects a `.ventoy` file in your CWD to make sure its running in the right spot (200GB of ISOs in your home dir would kinda sux)

It also depends on wget2, even tho normal wget would work just fine. wget2 is just more performant and has the cool looking download bars :D

There are no arguments, it just grabs all the guys. It does ask you per distro if you're happy with the URLs and if you wanna download the ISOs for that distro.

This script isnt really meant for anyone besides me, but I thought I might as well upload it incase its useful (or i wipe my configs and lose this after spending 6 hours on it)
